## Sensors Created

For each available collection type, two sensors are created:

### Collection Date Sensors
- `sensor.next_refuse_collection` - Next refuse collection date
- `sensor.next_recycling_collection` - Next recycling collection date  
- `sensor.next_food_collection` - Next food collection date (if available)
- `sensor.next_garden_collection` - Next garden collection date (if available)

**Attributes include:**
- `days_until_collection` - Number of days until next collection
- `status` - Human-readable status ("Today", "Tomorrow", "In X days")
- `is_collection_day` - Whether today is a collection day

### Live Status Sensors
- `sensor.refuse_collection_status` - Live refuse collection status
- `sensor.recycling_collection_status` - Live recycling collection status
- `sensor.food_collection_status` - Live food collection status (if available)
- `sensor.garden_collection_status` - Live garden collection status (if available)

**Attributes include:**
- `reason` - Status reason (e.g., "Street not yet completed")
- `schedule` - Collection schedule (e.g., "Wednesday every week")
- `round` - Collection round (e.g., "CK 14 Wed")
- `completed_time` - Exact time collection was completed (when applicable)

## Dashboard Cards

The integration includes an example dashboard configuration in `example-card.yaml`:

- **Collection Day Banner** - Shows when live tracking is active
- **Upcoming Collections** - Displays next collection dates with countdown
- **Live Status Cards** - Real-time collection progress on collection days
- **Completion Times** - Shows when collections were completed

Copy the configuration from `example-card.yaml` into your Home Assistant dashboard.

## How It Works

The integration connects to South Gloucestershire Council's waste management system:

1. **Address Lookup** - Uses your postcode to find your UPRN (Unique Property Reference Number)
2. **Collection Data** - Retrieves your specific collection schedule and live status
3. **Smart Updates** - Updates daily normally, every 15 minutes on collection days
4. **Collection Day Detection** - Recognizes when collections are scheduled or happening today
5. **Live Tracking** - Shows real-time progress: "In Progress", "Closed Completed", etc.

## API Endpoints

- **Address Lookup**: `https://webapps.southglos.gov.uk/Webservices/SGC.RefuseCollectionService/RefuseCollectionService.svc/getAddresses/{postcode}`
- **Collection Data**: `https://api.southglos.gov.uk/wastecomp/GetCollectionDetails?uprn={uprn}`

## Collection Types

- **Refuse** üóëÔ∏è - General household waste
- **Recycling** ‚ôªÔ∏è - Recyclable materials  
- **Food** üçé - Food waste (not available at all addresses)
- **Garden** üå≥ - Garden waste (seasonal/subscription service)

## Example Dashboard Display

## Troubleshooting

### No Collections Showing
- Verify your postcode is correct
- Check that collections are available for your address
- Some addresses may not have all collection types (e.g., Food collections)

### Integration Not Loading
- Restart Home Assistant after installation
- Check the Home Assistant logs for errors
- Ensure your Home Assistant can access external APIs

### Incorrect Collection Dates
- The integration shows data directly from South Gloucestershire Council
- Collection dates may change due to bank holidays or service disruptions
- Data updates automatically every 24 hours
